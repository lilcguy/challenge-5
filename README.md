# Workday Planner

## Description

This project is a scheduler for a typical 9 to 5 workday. Each hour contains an area that the user can input their activities that can be saved to the page. Depending on the time of day, the blocks are color-coded for past, present, and future. The project came with CSS presets loaded, but the HTML and JS was built from scratch. This is my first experience with what may be called a fullstack application with practical use.


- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


## Usage

The user can input data into the text area, click the save button, and save those activities to the planner. The color coded blocks show the user whether an event is upcoming, current, or past.
